# ReactJS Internship Week 1 Task: Registration Form

## Project Overview

This project is the first task of my ReactJS internship. The goal is to create a registration form with validation for required fields, without using any third-party libraries. The form collects user details such as First Name, Last Name, Username, Email, Password, Phone Number, Country, City, PAN No., and Aadhar No. The form includes features such as error messages for validation, show/hide password functionality, and disables submission until all fields are correctly filled. Upon successful submission, the entered details are displayed on a new route.

## Features

- **Form Validation:** Each field is validated to ensure that it is correctly filled before allowing submission.
- **Error Messages:** Displays appropriate error messages for each field that fails validation.
- **Show/Hide Password:** Allows users to toggle the visibility of the password field.
- **Dynamic Dropdowns:** Country and City dropdowns that adjust available options based on the selected country.
- **Responsive Design:** Form fields are arranged side by side for a clean and professional look.
- **Success Page:** Upon successful submission, a new route displays the entered details.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- React Router DOM
